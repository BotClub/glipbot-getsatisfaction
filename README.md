# GetSat Glipbot

GetSat Glipbot is a chatbot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

[hubot]: https://hubot.github.com/
[heroku]: https://heroku.com/
[generator-hubot]: https://github.com/hubotio/generator-hubot

It uses the following:

* [hubot-glip](https://github.com/tylerlong/hubot-glip) adatper - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-glip)
* [hubot-getsatisfaction](https://github.com/grokify/hubot-getsatisfaction) handler - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-getsatisfaction)

### Running GetSat Glipbot on Heroku

If you already have your Glip email address and password, you can use [Heroku One-Button Deployment](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button).

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

### Running GetSat Glipbot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start GetSat Glipbot locally by running `bin/hubot` with the `--name` parameter. The Glip and GetSat environment variables should be set.

    $ HUBOT_GLIP_SERVER=https://platform.ringcentral.com \
      HUBOT_GLIP_APP_KEY=MyGlipAppKey \
      HUBOT_GLIP_APP_SECRET=MyGlipAppSecret \
      HUBOT_GLIP_USERNAME=16505550123
      HUBOT_GLIP_EXTENSION=102
      HUBOT_GLIP_PASSWORD=MyUserPassword
      HUBOT_GETSATISFACTION_COMPANY=ringcentral \
      HUBOT_GETSATISFACTION_VIEW=markdown \
      ./bin/hubot -n hubot -a glip

You'll see some start up output such as:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379

Then you can interact with GetSatGlipbot by typing `GetSatGlipbot help`.

    gsbot gs help
    gsbot gs search topics sort:votes glip
    ...

##  Persistence

If you are going to use the `hubot-redis-brain` package (strongly suggested),
you will need to add the Redis to Go addon on Heroku which requires a verified
account or you can create an account at [Redis to Go][redistogo] and manually
set the `REDISTOGO_URL` variable.

    % heroku config:add REDISTOGO_URL="..."

If you don't need any persistence feel free to remove the `hubot-redis-brain`
from `external-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry about redis at all.

[redistogo]: https://redistogo.com/

## Deployment

    % heroku create --stack cedar
    % git push heroku master

If your Heroku account has been verified you can run the following to enable
and add the Redis to Go addon to your app.

    % heroku addons:add redistogo:nano

If you run into any problems, checkout Heroku's [docs][heroku-node-docs].

You'll need to edit the `Procfile` to set the name of your hubot.

More detailed documentation can be found on the [deploying hubot onto
Heroku][deploy-heroku] wiki page.
